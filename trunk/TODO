* finish the json_free_value function so that it really frees all allocated memory 
* implement decent error handling on the parsing functions
* support parsing incomplete documents (streaming, stdin)
* test the library's hability to handle Unicode characters
* implement a standard and nice looking method to format the source code
* replace all the rstring training wheel wrapper stuff with wchar_t strings (use the wrapper struct only internally?)
